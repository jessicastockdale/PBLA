We provide here code to generate the results found in the paper, as well as the publically-available data used. The Foot and Mouth outbreak data are not able to be shared, but we provide the code so that it may be adapted for similar analysis of heterogeneous mixing datasets.

## Usage

The code is written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and C++ code will also be called through [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html). Required R packages will be installed automatically. C++ code requires use of [GSL libraries](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)

## Organization
* `data`: datasets used in the paper
* `code`: code to run PBLA and the compared methods

## Datasets

Datasets included in this repository are:

1. Respiratory disease in Tristan da Cunha
2. Ebola in West Africa
