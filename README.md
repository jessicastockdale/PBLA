We provide here code to generate the results shown in the paper, as well as the publically-available data used. The Foot and Mouth outbreak data are not able to be shared, but instead we provide simulated data in the same format. 

## Usage

The code is written in [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) and `C`. Required `R` packages will be installed automatically. `C` code requires use of [GSL libraries] (https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)

## Organization
* `data`: datasets used in the paper
* `code`: code to run PBLA and the compared methods

## Datasets

Datasets included in this repository are:

1. Respiratory disease in Tristan da Cunha
2. Ebola in West Africa
3. Simulated dataset for a heterogeneously mixing outbreak with spatial component.
