# Code to generate results in the PBLA paper

Here we provide the necessary pieces of code to, alongside the files in the data folder, replicate the results found in the PBLA paper. 
The files here are:

* 'tdc_ed.R' - code to generate Eichner Dietz method results for the Tristan Da Cunha data, and generate plots comparing the three methods
* 'file.txt' - description of file
